//Stack Sorting
/*
 * 
 Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order (with biggest items on top).
 You may use at most one additional stack to hold items, but you may not copy the
 elements into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the
 following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
